🔥# What is Git & GitHub?

Git is a Version Control System (VCS) that helps track changes in code.
GitHub is an online platform that makes Git easier to use with collaboration features.
🛠️ Think of Git as a toolbox and GitHub as a workshop where multiple developers can work together!

🔄 #GitHub Workflow

Repositories 🗂️ → Project folders containing files and history.

Branches 🌱 → Allow working on new features without changing the main code.

Commits 💾 → Save changes with a message describing them.

Push 📤 → Upload commits from local to remote repository.

Pull Requests 🔄 → Request to merge changes into the main branch after review.

Forking 🍴 → Copy a repository to experiment without affecting the original.

Issues 📝 → Track bugs, tasks, and improvements.

“GitHub makes coding teamwork seamless and organized.”

#Doubts popped in my mind while going through the course

 If me and my teammate edit the same line in a file? How does Git decide which one to keep? Do you have to manually merge them?
 
 How does it handle things like images, videos, or large datasets?
